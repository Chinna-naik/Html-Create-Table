# Html-Create-Table
💻✨ Just Designed a Course Table Web Page Using HTML! ✨💻

I’m excited to share one of my beginner-level web development projects — a Course Table built using only HTML. This mini project helped me practice how to structure content using tables, align data, and style it for easy readability.

📋 Project Overview:
I created a simple course table that displays the course name, duration, instructor, and fees for different courses. Here's what I used:

🟢 Table Tags – To organize and display the data in a tabular format
🟢 Table Rows (<tr>) – To define the rows for each course
🟢 Table Headers (<th>) – To label each column with descriptive titles
🟢 Table Data (<td>) – To fill in each cell with course-specific information
🟢 Alignment and Background Color – To enhance readability and make the table visually appealing

🧑‍🏫 Course Structure Includes:
✅ Course Name: Java Full Stack, Web Development, Python Programming
✅ Duration: 6 Months, 4 Months, 3 Months
✅ Instructor: Nivas, Hemantha, Tarun
✅ Fees: ₹25,000, ₹18,000, ₹15,000

🧠 What I Learned:
✅ How to structure data using HTML tables
✅ Using table-related tags like <th>, <td>, and <tr>
✅ Aligning table data with attributes like align and bgcolor
✅ Formatting tables with styling to improve readability
✅ Writing cleaner, more organized code for future projects

🔧 Tools Used:

1.HTML5
2.VS Code (Text Editor)

It was a great experience putting this together, and I’m looking forward to improving my HTML skills and adding more interactivity in future projects!

Feel free to take a look at the code and share any suggestions or improvements. 😊
